<h2>About Timmer</h2>

<p><i>Introducing your ultimate secretary, whether you're at home, or at work.</i></p><br>
<p>Our application runs in a mobile platform, while also having a web platform on the other side for back-up reasons. Specifically, it aims to: Make a list of logs given by a user to generate a time-efficient and reliable list, each day, for span of one week. The logs, which can be freely edited by the user, will be arranged according to the set of criteria of the system. The project can also accumulate data from Facebook and/or Google for any calendar activities of the user, incorporating them on the userâ€™s logs. Each change made by the user will affect the current and the future system generated list. </p>
